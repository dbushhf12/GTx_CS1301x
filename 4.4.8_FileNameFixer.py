#You've been sent a list of names. Unfortunately, the names
#come in two different formats:
#
#First Middle Last
#Last, First Middle
#
#You want the entire list to be the same. For this problem,
#we'll say you want the entire list to be First Middle Last.
#
#Write a function called name_fixer. name_fixer should have two
#parameters: an output filename (the first parameter) and the
#input filename (the second parameter). You may assume that every
#line will match one of the two formats above: either First Middle
#Last or Last, First Middle. 
#
#name_fixer should write to the output file the names all
#structured as First Middle Last. If the name was already structured
#as First Middle Last, it should remain unchanged. If it was
#structured as Last, First Middle, then Last should be moved
#to the end after a space and the comma removed.
#
#The names should appear in the same order as the original file.
#
#For example, if the input file contained the following lines:
#David Andrew Joyner
#Hart, Melissa Joan
#Cyrus, Billy Ray
#
#...then the output file should contain these lines:
#David Andrew Joyner
#Melissa Joan Hart
#Billy Ray Cyrus


#Add your code here!

    for i in list_of_names:
        if "," in i:
            i = i.strip()
            x = i.rfind(",")
            y = i[:x]
            j = i[x+2:] + " " + y

#The code below will test your function. You can find the two
#files it references in the drop-down in the top left. If your
#code works, output_file.txt should have the text:
#David Andrew Joyner
#Melissa Joan Hart
#Billy Ray Cyrus
name_fixer("output_file.txt", "input_file.txt")
print("Done running! Check output_file.txt for the result.")

#If you accidentally erase input_file.txt, here's its original
#text to copy back in (remove the pound signs):
#David Andrew Joyner
#Hart, Melissa Joan
#Cyrus, Billy Ray
