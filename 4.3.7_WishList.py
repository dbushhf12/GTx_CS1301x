#Write a function called wish_list. wish_list should have
#four parameters, in this order: 
#
# - a list of strings, representing a list of items on a
#   wish list
# - a string, representing a particular item
# - a float, representing the cost of this item
# - a float, representing your budget
#
#If the item is on the list and you can afford it (cost is
#less than or equal to budget), return the string,
#"You should buy a [item name]!", replacing [item name]
#with the string.
#
#If the item is on the list but you can't afford it,
#return the string, "You should save up for a [item name]!",
#replacing [item name] with the string.
#
#If the item is not on the list, you should return the
#string "You probably don't want to buy a [item name].",
#replacing [item name] with the string.
#
#HINT: You do not need a loop to solve this. You can use
#one, but you don't need one.


#Add your function here!

#You can change the value of the variable(s) to test your
