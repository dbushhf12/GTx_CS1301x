#You may modify the lines of code above, but don't move them!
#When you Submit your code, we'll change these lines to
#assign different values to the variables.

#There are (at least) three special types of full moons:
#
# - Super Moon: the full moon occurs when the moon is at its
#   closest approach to earth (less than 230,000km away).
# - Blue Moon: the second full moon in a calendar month. In
#   other words, any full moon on the 29th, 30th, or 31st of
#   a month.
# - Blood Moon: a lunar eclipse during a full moon.
#
#Write a program that will print out the type of moon --
#"Full Moon", "Super Moon", "Blue Moon", "Blood Moon", based
#on the values of the variables above. Note that for the moon
#to be any of these special kinds of moons, it must also be
#full.
#
#Note, though, that multiple modifiers can be true at the same
#time. We could have a Super Blue Moon, a Blue Blood Moon, or
#even a Super Blue Blood Moon.
#
#Always print those modifiers in that order. If any of these
#special modifiers is present, do not include the word "Full".
#If none of them are present, but the moon is Full, then print
#"Full Moon". If none of them are present at all, print "Moon".
